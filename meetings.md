# Meetings notes

## Meeting 1.
* **DATE:18-03-2020**
* **ASSISTANTS: Mika Oja**

### Minutes
*Summary of what was discussed during the meeting*
Instead of a meeting, I received feedback from the assistant via email.

### Action points
*List here the actions points discussed with assistants*
My db-concept perhaps went a bit too deep into details at this stage, and thus made the overall concept a bit hard to grasp. No actions needed.

Related work was missing at this stage. Filled in on 31-04-2020.

## Meeting 4.
* **DATE:23-04-2020**
* **STAFF: Iván Sanchez Milara**

### Minutes
*Summary of what was discussed during the meeting*
We went over my API implementation and checked that tests pass. Then I had some questions, which are recorded in the NOTES under DL4 "LIst of implemented resources" -part. Mainly, Iván clarified the meaning of idempotency of the HTTP PUT method and it's not advisable to allow change of the URI of a resource. Also, we discussed about how to separate different causes for db IntegrityError and communicate these to the client. Lastly, we discussed an approach for a UniqueConstraint with my Component resource.

### Action points
*List here the actions points discussed with assistants*
Formerly I had my resources identified by it's name. This was problematic for the PUT method, as I wanted the name to be modifiable. Thus I took an action point to change all resources URIs to something generated by the API and unchangeable by a client once a resource is created by POST method.

As per Iváns suggestion, I decided to cover my Component resource db UniqueContraint by setting the "active service" component's retired_date far far into the future (9999-12-31 23:59:59). Thus there now are no null-values for date_retired for any component row in the db and the UniqueConstraint applies nicely.

## Midterm meeting
* **DATE:27-03-2020**
* **ASSISTANTS: Iván Sanchez Milara**

### Minutes
*Summary of what was discussed during the meeting*
We exchanged a few emails considering the following questions I had:
__One technical question regarding databases. My database models include a parent (Equipment), which can have children (Components). Both can be "retired", or in other words, given a value date_retired as type datetime. I'd the logic to be such, that if the parent is retired (given a retired date), all the associated children are also retired (also given a retired date). Can this be done through the database models, or should the logic be somewhere else, like in the request processing?

Also, did I get my one-to-one/one-to-many and uniqueness things right? Here's how things should be:
<ul>
<li>Equipment can be owned by only one user.</li>
<li>A component can only belong to one Equipment</li>
<li>A ride can be ridden by more than one User</li>
<li>A ride can only be ridden with one Equipment.</li>
</ul>__

Then we had the midterm meeting over Zoom.
In the meeting we went through the db implementation and tests. Then discussed further about my emailed questions. Iván mentioned concerns about my design having a bit too many resources (11) to implement and test considering the time left to finish the course.

### Action points
*List here the actions points discussed with assistants*
Need to cut back on how many resources are actually implemented and tested with the API.  
Eventually settled on five resources in the final implementation.
